For all elements in our \emph{universal data structure}, we'll use this
\emph{base class}, which can represent objects and linked groups of them form a
\emph{directed hypergraph}.

\lst{doc/core/object0.py}{py}{base node class for \term{object graph} \ref{og}\ }

The idea about this primitive element was taken from the concept of
\term{frame}s which is more or less known from the AI domain \cite{minsky}:
\begin{description}
    \item[object] frame
    \item[slot] stringy name which points to other frame as it's value
    \item[attributes] objects fields are hidden\\
    some \term{host language}s\note{the programming language you are using for
    \mel\ method /\py\ in our case/}\ do not let to use arbitrary object fields
    and add them randomly at runtime, thats why slots required
    \item[nest] \emph{original frames lack ordering capability}, so I expanded
    them to reflect things like AST for source code representing \ref{ast}
    \item[method] \emph{adds active nature} to the data structure thus it can be
    executed and also transform itself \ref{eds}
\end{description}
